Goals:
Entertainment and Learning:
Create an engaging word-guessing game that challenges users' vocabulary and logical thinking skills.

Code Organization:
Develop a well-structured and modular program using functions, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

User Interaction:
Provide an intuitive and interactive gaming experience by including clear instructions, category selection, and real-time feedback during the game.

Scalability:
Lay the foundation for adding advanced features like file handling (e.g., loading/saving scores or custom word lists) and more complex game-ending logic in future iterations.

Randomization:
Use randomness to ensure replayability by selecting words dynamically from predefined categories.

Objectives:
Category and Word Selection:

Allow users to select a category from multiple options.
Randomly choose a word from the selected category for each game session.
Guessing Logic:

Display a partially hidden word with underscores (_) for unguessed letters.
Update the display with correct guesses, and show progress in real-time.
Error Handling:

Track incorrect guesses and limit them to a maximum of six attempts.
Display a "hangman" visual to represent the remaining attempts.
Feedback and Messages:

Provide feedback on whether the guessed letter is correct or incorrect.
Show congratulatory messages for a win or reveal the correct word on a loss.
Replayability:

Enable users to play multiple rounds with new words or exit the game gracefully.
